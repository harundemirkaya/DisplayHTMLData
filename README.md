Display HTML Data in Swift

Sometimes we pull the texts we use on our application screens from the internet. In such cases, CSS extensions can be included in the text of the data we pull from the internet. While developing IOS with Swift, we can run CSS expressions in the texts we will use on these screens with a single extension String function! All you have to do for this is to review the ViewController file in this repo!
